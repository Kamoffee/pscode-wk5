// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
- ask for two numbers a, b 
- divide those  numbers to each other by using the modulus sign (%) (a % b or b % a)
- if the result doesn t have a remainder, then the number is even
- if the result does have a remainder, then the number is odd
- print (if number is even or odd) after each calculus

	input(a, b)
	if a % b = 0 
		print(number is even)
	if b % a = 0
		print(number is even)
	if a % b != 0
		print(number is odd) 
	if b % a != 0
		print(number is odd) 
		
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 
- ask for 5 separate numbers
	a != b !=c != d != e
	
	input (a, b, c, d, e)
	print(a, b, c, d, e)

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
-sum the numbers chosen and then divide them by how many numbers you chose
	sum = a + b + c + d + e
	average_result = sum / 5
		print (average_result)

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

- use the prebuilt function (min() in python) which will find the minimum number 
- print (minumum number)
- use the prebuilt function (max() in python) which will find the maximum number
- print (maximum number)

	minimum_number = min(numbers) 
	print(minimum_number)
	
	maximum_number = max(numbers)
	print(maximum_number)
	

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
(Your pseudocode here)
	print('The average result in the numbers chosen is {average_result})
	print('The minimum number from the numbers chosen is {minimum_number} 
		and the maximum number is {maximum_number})
